Cheatsheet of tips &amp; tricks to avoid getting caught using AI in coding job interviews

## Intro üèÜ
Unless you want to grind on leetcode practice problems for months, just use AI...

## What NOT to do üò±
- don't try to type questions into ChatGPT, as it'll take too long, the interviewer will hear you typing (but wonder what website you're typing into, as they won't see it), you won't have time to setup a proper prompt.  They'll get suspicious/fail you.
- don't try to copy and paste the question into Github Copilot, as almost all interview platforms are collaborative and will show your interviewer what text you're highlighting and copying.  Immediate red flag.
- do not click on any other Chrome tab or window once your interview starts, as some platforms like Coderpad will display a notification saying that you've left the interview tab.  You can try to say it was a mistake, but it shouldn't happen again.
- do not use multiple monitors, as some platforms like Hackerrank will ask for permission to manage your windows, and try to [detect](https://customersupport.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/17793999314963-Multiple-Monitor-Detection) if you're using multiple monitors

## Tools that can help üöÄ
- [Chatmagic](https://www.chatmagic.app) - Chrome extension that generates code solutions to interview questions you screenshot using a keyboard shortcut.  Free to try, then $49/month.  Also works for system design interviews
- [Interviewcoder](https://interviewcoder.co/) - Desktop app to get solutions to coding questions in interviews.  $60/month
- [Leetcodewizard](https://leetcodewizard.io/pricing) - Desktop app to get solutions to interview questions.  $49/month

## Tips ‚ú®
- Get a single large monitor, and keep two Chrome windows side-by-side (one with the interview, one with your AI tool)
- screenshot the question instead of trying to copy/paste or type it into the AI
- while you wait for the answer, try asking clarifying questions about input data validation, edge cases, etc.
- You still need to know CS fundamentals, in case you get asked to explain why you did things a certain way, or how to further optimize things.

## Models & Prompts ü§î
- There is a tradeoff in model quality vs. speed.  Deepseek and Gemini 2.5 Pro may be very good, but are quite a bit slower than GPT 4o or Gemini 2 flash.
- Play with the prompts to get the output you want in terms of language, explanations, examples, etc.
